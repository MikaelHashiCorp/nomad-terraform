# Provision a Nomad cluster with Terraform

Easily provision a fully functional and integrated HashiCorp sandbox environment in the cloud. The goal is to allow easy exploration of Nomad, including the integrations with Consul and Vault. A number of [examples] (examples/README.md) are included.

See the README in the [AWS] (aws/README.md) subdirectory to get started.
